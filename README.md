# Zhu_Britney_Project6
Project 6 for AMS 595.01 Fall 2025 using Python - Jupyter Notebook.


## How to run the code
Download the files.
Run "Py_Project_4" using Python Jupyter Notebook.
The Questions 1 to 4 should be answered already. Question 1 is just uploading the files to github. 

However for Question 5, there is separate ipynb.files "Py_Project_4_Q5_Original.ipynb" and "Py_Project_4_Q5_Modified.ipynb". You need to download the datasets "test_catvnoncat.h5"and "train_catvnoncat.h5" to run the code.
